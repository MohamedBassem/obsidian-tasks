## Intelligent auto-complete

> Introduced in Tasks 1.9.0.

The [Priorities]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/priority.md %}), [Dates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/dates.md %}) and [Recurring Tasks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/recurring-tasks.md %}) pages show various emojis and special phrases that the Tasks plugin recognises, when searching for tasks.

If you prefer to type your tasks, instead of using a dialog, there is now a mechanism that does a
lot of the typing of emojis and dates for you!

It is best understood by watching a [video of it in action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10722656/175102574-78b0f851-cc48-4255-a40e-d3036bec5bb6.gif).
